Calvaria is a 3d-printable keyboard case including a top-mount thick plate.

This repository includes a combined STEP file as well as individual STLs with suggested print orientation. Two different bottom options are available; flat and 2 degree negative typing angle.

The plate has an added tolerance of .20 mm for the switch cutouts. This can be adjusted in the included FreeCAD project file.

## Additional hardware

- 4x M2 5 mm screws
- 12x M3 x D5.0 x L3.0 heat inserts
- 12x M3 16 mm screws - for aesthetic reasons socket head screws are recommended but any M3 will work
